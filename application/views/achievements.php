                                    <p>Viral Bhatt, developed a keen interest in tracking and understanding of financial markets, macroeconomic concepts right from his teens, decided to pursue a career into the finance space right from the beginning. He took the first step by completing “Certified financial planning” from an International college of financial planning in 2007. He has worked in various domain’s under the financial umbrella at Bajaj Capital and Karvy wealth, before taking an entrepreneurial leap in partnership with his colleague. Starting something on his own was always on his radar, and it finally materialised in 2015, when he started Money Mantra, his venture which helps clients to attain financial well being.</p>

                                   
                                    <p>He kept on adding skillsets on the way by attaining specialised certifications from various industry bodies such as-

                                    Retirement readiness certification – NISM<br>
                                    Certification on Insurance – IRDA</p>
                                    <p></p>

                                    <P>In an industry where miss-selling, unfortunately, is a common phenomenon, and mutual funds are sold as just products without keeping the bigger picture in mind, Viral set out to create a differentiation. He set an example and demonstrated that financial advice has to be selfless and attaining clients goals has to be given the utmost importance. He also pioneered the use of technology and social media amongst personal finance professionals which helps him to keep in touch with his clients on a regular basis and educating them on important aspects</P>

                                    <p>He is also part of an elite industry body – Network FP, where he has lead various task forces and brought about innovations beneficial to the fraternity at large.</p>

                                    <p>His achievements were noticed by eminent publications across the country, who approach him to seek his views on important financial events. Viral can often been seen in newspapers for his industrial and social contributions.</P>
